# HeartToHeart
Given the medical records, we wish to predict whether a person has heart disease or not. 

All the data and detailed dictionary is present at  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

The `heartToheart.ipynb` file contains the experimentation reports and the `main.py` is a gist of the algorithm.
The model, fitted and trained, is in `clf` in `main`. For a complete overview of the project please refer to the jupyter notebook.
